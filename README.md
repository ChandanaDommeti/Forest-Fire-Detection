# 🔥 Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning

Week 1 Assignment – Green SHELL AICTE Internship

## 🧠 Overview

This project aims to classify images into two categories — fire and no fire — using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow. It introduces the basic concepts of Deep Learning and how image data can be processed and used to train models for forest fire detection.

## 📘 Key Concepts Covered

* What is Deep Learning (DL)?
* What is a Neural Network?
* Types of Neural Networks:

  * CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
  * RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
  * ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
* What is CNN in simple terms?
* Project pipeline for image classification using CNN

## 🧪 Project Pipeline

1. 📥 Data Collection:

   * Dataset sourced from open data platforms like Kaggle.
   * Contains 3 main folders: train, test, and val.
   * Each contains fire and non-fire subfolders for binary classification.

2. 🖼️ Image Processing & Augmentation:

   * Resize images to uniform dimensions.
   * Apply transformations (horizontal/vertical flips, etc.) to enrich dataset.

3. 🧱 CNN Model Building:

   * Built using TensorFlow and Keras.
   * Trained to detect fire in images.

4. 📊 Model Testing & Evaluation:

   * Model accuracy and performance evaluated using validation data.
